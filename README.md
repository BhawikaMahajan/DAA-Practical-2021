### TIME COMPLEXITIES :

##### Ques1: Insertion and Deletion in red black tree:
*This is basically based on the rotations a red black tree requires for a particaular insertion or deletion*
###### Time complexity for insertion and deletion in red black tree is :O(log n)
*This is because the maximum height of a red black tree almost same as balanced tree.*

##### Ques2: Greedy approach for finding minimum spanning tree of graph:
*This can by done using Kruskal's algorithm:*
###### Time complexity for finding minimum spanning tree is O(E logV)

##### Ques3:Following are shown in series best average and worst:
                
|Algorithm         |TimeComplexity |             |           |
|------------------|:-------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
|                  | Best          | Average     | worst     |
|Insertion sort    | Ω(n)          |θ(n^2)       | O(n^2)    |
|Selection Sort	   |  Ω(n^2)       | θ(n^2)      |	O(n^2)   |
|Quick Sort        | Ω(n log(n))   |θ(n log(n))	 | O(n^2)    |
|Merge Sort	       | Ω(n log(n))   |θ(n log(n))	 |O(n log(n))|
|Bubble Sort	     |Ω(n)           | 	θ(n^2)	   | O(n^2)    |
        
### APPLICATIONS :

##### (A) RED BLACK TREE :
###### Red black tree is used in process scheduling algorithms as it helps in faster insertions,retrievals and also it stores the elements in sorted order.

##### (B) MINIMUM SPANNING TREE :
###### These are mostly applied in network designs , also used to solve complex mathematics and in cluster analysis too.

##### (C) 
*(i) INSERTION SORT : mostly used when no. of elements is small and useful when array is almost sorted.*

*(ii) SELECTION SORT :It is an in place sorting technique and do not requires a lot of space for sorting.*

*(iii) QUICK SORT :It is the fastest of all sorting techniques and used almost everywhere where stable sort is not needed.*

*(iv) MERGE SORT :Used for sorting linked lists, also used for counting inversions in a list.*

*(v) BUBBLE SORT :It uses less storage space.Can be used to sort the unsorted elements in a specifc order.*
