### TIME COMPLEXITIES :

##### Ques1: Insertion and Deletion in red black tree:
*This is basically based on the rotations a red black tree requires for a particaular insertion or deletion*
###### Time complexity for insertion and deletion in red black tree is :O(log n)
*This is because the maximum height of a red black tree almost same as balanced tree.*

##### Ques2: Greedy approach for finding minimum spanning tree of graph:
*This can by done using Kruskel's algorithm:*
###### Time complexity for finding minimum spanning tree is O(E logV)

##### Ques3: Insertion Sort (worst
